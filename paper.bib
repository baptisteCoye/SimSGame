In this paper we survey the state of the art with respect to optimization and approximation algorithms and interpret these in terms of computational complexity theory. Special cases considered are single machine scheduling, identical, uniform and unrelated parallel machine scheduling, and open shop, flow shop and job shop scheduling. We indicate some problems for future research and include a selective bibliography.},

a program which consists of a set of partially ordered tasks is studied. Cases where
task execution times are deterministic and others in which execution times are random
variables are analyzed. It is shown that different algorithms suggested in the literature
vary significantly in execution time and that the B-schedule of Coffman and Graham
is near-optimal. A dynamic programming solution for the case in which execution times
are random variables is presented.},

abstract="When independent tasks are to be scheduled onto identical processors, the typical goal is to minimize the makespan. A simple and efficient heuristic consists in scheduling first the task with the longest processing time (LPT heuristic), and to plan its execution as soon as possible. While the performance of LPT has already been largely studied, in particular its asymptotic performance, we revisit results and propose a novel analysis for the case of tasks generated through uniform integer compositions. Also, we perform extensive simulations to empirically assess the asymptotic performance ofÂ LPT. Results demonstrate that the absolute error rapidly tends to zero for several distributions of task costs, including ones studied by theoretical models, and realistic distributions coming from benchmarks.",
